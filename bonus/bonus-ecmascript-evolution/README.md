### Ecmascript evolution

ECMAScript is the standard upon which JavaScript is based, and it's often abbreviated to ES. Since the first version of ECMAScript, which was released in 1997, there have been many changes and additions to the language. With the release of ES6 in 2015, JavaScript has been evolving faster than ever, with new versions coming out every year.

In this module, you'll learn about the evolution of ECMAScript, from ES1 to the most recent version, ES14. You'll also learn about the new features that have been added to the language, and how to use them in your code.

### Course content

1. Introduction to ECMAScript

- What is ECMAScript? and its history.
    - ECMAScript is a standard for scripting languages, such as JavaScript. It defines the core features of the language and how they should be implemented.
    - The history of ECMAScript: ECMAScript was first released in 1997, and has been evolving ever since. There have been many versions of the standard, each introducing new features and improvements. It all started with browser wars and the need for a standard language that could be implemented by all browsers. 

- The relationship between ECMAScript and JavaScript.
    - JavaScript is a programming language that is based on ECMAScript. It is the most popular implementation of the ECMAScript standard, and is used in web development to create interactive and dynamic websites.
    - JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript standard. This means that JavaScript is based on the ECMAScript standard, and implements the features defined in the standard. However, JavaScript also includes additional features that are not part of the ECMAScript standard, such as the DOM (Document Object Model) and the BOM (Browser Object Model).

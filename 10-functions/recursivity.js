// let ax = 1;

//     console.log(ax); // shows 1, 2, 3, 4
//     if(ax === 5){ // condition flag to stop the recursion
//         console.log("it never entered here");

// What's the difference between the two snippets, by function naming?

// Basically, the first snippet is a named function, and the second snippet is an anonymous function.
// The difference is that the named function can be called by its name, and the anonymous function can be called by the variable that holds it.
// In the first snippet, the function is called by its name, and in the second snippet, 
// the function is called by the variable that holds it. 
// The result is the same, but the way to call the function is different.
